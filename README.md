# Tanks Clicker

Tanks clicker is a simple idle clicking game inspired by World of Tanks. As of right now, the game currently only has 1 playable nation, the USSR, but plans are in place (of course) to add more countries.

## Changelog

  - The first upgrade of the tank will start at 100,000 credits. After each upgrade, the price will increase by 50% of the previous upgrade cost.
- Changed some styling.
- Added a tips section to the left side of the screen.

## Current Content

As of right now, when the game begins you can select the USSR as your starting country. You start by clicking the tank to earn credits. The first upgrade you should buy after clicking on the tank for a bit is the consumable upgrade. Not only does this upgrade boost your credit production and makes it so you don't have to click, it also provides a small boost for gold production which can help once you unlock it at 50,000 credits. The equipment upgrade is by far the most powerful and it only costs 1,250 credits for 1. The first equipment upgrade you buy will give you 20 credits per second. More and more of things will be added to the game, but as of right now I am only trying to add the core game mechanics before I add the fluff.
