#### Why this versioning?

Currently, I am only incrementing the minor version until the game has enough content to actually be a game. Once I reach that point, it will go to v1.#.#. Until then, I'm only going to change the minor number. Even though some updates will include new features and others will only be small hot fixes, like I said, the minor number will be the only thing increasing until I am happy with the game.
