# Tanks Clicker

Tanks clicker is a simple idle clicking game inspired by World of Tanks. As of right now, the game currently only has 1 playable nation, the USSR, but plans are in place (of course) to add more countries.

#### Why this versioning?
Currently, I am only incrementing the minor version until the game has enough content to actually be a game. Once I reach that point, it will go to v1.#.#. Until then, I'm only going to change the minor number. Even though some updates will include new features and others will only be small hot fixes, like I said, the minor number will be the only thing increasing until I am happy with the game.
